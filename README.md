## Keith Rodney

I’m a web developer who enjoys **tinkering, building ideas from scratch, and improving them over time**. I’ve been coding since **2020**, and most of what I’ve learned comes from real experience building things, both for myself and for clients.

I mainly work on the web using **JavaScript and React**, with a strong focus on **UX/UI, creativity, and user-centred design**. I care a lot about how things look, feel, and flow, not just whether they technically work.

A lot of my projects start small, then evolve through experimentation, feedback, and iteration. I enjoy the process of refining ideas until they’re simple, practical, and actually useful.

### What I work with
- JavaScript & React  
- HTML & CSS  
- Basic backend concepts (auth, data, APIs)  

### How I like to build
- User experience matters as much as the code  
- Simple, practical solutions over over-engineering  
- Iteration and improvement are part of the process  
- Clean visuals and thoughtful interactions  

### Why I build
I build because I enjoy it. Some projects are hobbies, some turn into freelance work, and others are just experiments to learn something new. I’m especially interested in building tools that solve real problems or make systems easier to use.

### What you’ll find here
- Personal projects and experiments  
- Iterative builds that improve over time  
- Practical web apps, not just one-off demos
